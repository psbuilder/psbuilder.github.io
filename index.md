PsBuilder (a.k.a. PoshBuilder or PWSHBuilder) is a simple, free, and open source tool for building any PowerShell
module or script. It was originally created in January 2022, under the BSD
3-Clause license.

## Try PsBuilder
Download the most stable version of PsBuilder [here](https://github.com/psbuilder/psbuilder/releases/download/1.0/PsBuilder.ps1) or
[download a specific version](https://github.com/psbuilder/psbuilder/releases).

If you are looking for a nightly build, we've got them in [GH Actions](https://github.com/psbuilder/psbuilder/actions/workflows/exporter.yml). Go to "Artifacts"
and click "psbuilder".

We also got beta releases, which are not created every time a developer makes a change to PsBuilder, but rather when it is ready as not for production.
