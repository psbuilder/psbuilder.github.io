These words are considered very confusing. You should avoid them or use them with care.

# "*Pester test*"
"Pester" seems confusing because we need to use it as an important tool, so it's a dependency of PsBuilder. The developers call it Pester by mistake. So, please call it "Pester/PsBuilder" to give credit to the PsBuilder Project and to distinguish between both Pester and PsBuilder.
# "*PBG test*"
PBG, meaning *Pester, BASH and Git* is confusing since it contains another confusing word, [*Pester*](#pester-test). So instead, you would call it "PPBG", so that would be *PsBuilder, Pester, BASH and Git*.
